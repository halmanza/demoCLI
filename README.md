# DEMO CLI

    A CLI Project that will attempt to create a useful utility for various conversion of values to common types used in every day development.
### Example Value Type Utilities
- String to Base64
- String to binary string representation
- String to binary string with added byte delimiter
- Byte Array, UInt8Array decoded to string
- Byte array, UInt8Array with delimiter to string


### Project Intentions
    The primary purpose is to work on producing a useful utility CLI for everyday user utilities. At the same time its an opportunity for me to learn more about producing a npm package. It would be great if something useful for multiple developers arose out of this project

*I may be over Ambitious :]*
